/*

from my understsanding a carousel is slideshow component for going through elementsâ€”images or slides of text.This is done by creating a section in your html page and putting 
your elements in an odered list,making some buttons , making the list and buttons look good using css eg to position the carousel box anf the list in the box and finally we add interactivity with 
the carousel using js firstly by putting all our elements in an  format so we can iterate though the elements.Then we add some functionality to the buttons(back&next),using event listeners(2 seperate ones as each button does different tasks)- these are functions that tell buttons what action to take when clicked.
 This will enable us  navigate through the elements  in the carousel with ease*/
